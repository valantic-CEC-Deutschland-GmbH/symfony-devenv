# Devenv.sh - Symfony and Shopware 6 Dev-Env

![Hackathon](./hackathon.png)

## Task

Fiddle around with [devenv.sh](https://devenv.sh) and create a development environment for shopware 6 and symfony.  

## How to

1. Follow the [instructions](https://developer.shopware.com/docs/guides/installation/devenv#installation) to set up Nix, Cachix and Devenv.sh (skip any following instructions)
2. Continue with the installation of [direnv](https://developer.shopware.com/docs/guides/installation/devenv#direnv) and ignore the next section
3. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/valantic-CEC-Deutschland-GmbH/symfony-devenv.git`
4. Go into the directory `cd symfony-devenv` and `direnv` will automatically load the environment / configurations
5. Start your environment with `devenv up` (it will start all services within the terminal in the foreground)
6. Open a new terminal and navigate into the project root dir
7. Choose between the installation of symfony or shopware 6 with the underlying commands

> If you have Nix, Cachix, Devenv.sh and Direnv already installed, you can directly follow the steps below  

### Create a new Symfony project 
```bash
# choose your desired version
❯ symfony new project --no-interaction # creates a symfony skeleton trough the symfony-cli
❯ symfony demo project --no-interaction # creates a symfony demo trough the symfony-cli
```

### Create new Shopware 6 project

### Full automated setup for development
```bash
❯ sw-dev # just type this command in the root dir
```

**The following steps are executed through the command**
```bash
❯ composer create-project shopware/production project --no-interaction \
&& cd ./project
&& composer req --dev dev-tools symfony/var-dumper symfony/web-profiler-bundle maltyxx/images-generator mbezhanov/faker-provider-collection frosh/development-helper frosh/tools
&& bin/console system:install --basic-setup
```

### Manual installation 
```bash
❯ composer create-project shopware/production project --no-interaction
```

## Access

Open `127.0.0.1:8000` and your dev-env is ready 🎉


## Delete current project for a new installation
```bash
❯ clean # just type this command in the root dir
```

## Kill all devenv processes
> Because its currently not possible to start the devenv setup in the background as deamon, this command could be handy. If your terminal session dies and you still have devenv processes running, execute this command:
```bash
# add this line to .bashrc, .zshrc or your shell of you choice to have the command "dkill" available
alias dkill="kill $(ps -ax | grep /nix/store  | awk '{print $1}')" # kill all devenv.sh processes
```
